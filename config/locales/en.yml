      what_is_nomad_text_html: |
        As digital nomads, one of drivers for choosing our next destination
        is whether there  will be other digital nomads around us &#x1F64B Loneliness and isolation
        are no fun when you travel alone &#x1F613 And as we move quite often, this question poses
        fairly frequently. This is where nomadmap comes handy &#x1F64C
        <br>
        <br>
        Next time you wonder where to next? just browse the map! You'll get access
        to the real-time position of other digital nomads &#x1F389 You can get their contact details
        and have a chat or catch up! Then, the only remaining question is, who do I want to meet next? &#x1F680
