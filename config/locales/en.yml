      what_is_nomad_text_html: |
        As digital nomads, the main driver for choosing our next destination is whether we will be able to find others nomads there.
        As we move quite often, this question poses fairly frequently. This is where nomadmap comes handy!
        <br>
        <br>
        Next time you wonder where to next?, just browse the map! You'll get access to other digital nomads' current location.
        You can even contact them in advance. The only question will then be, who do I want to meet next?
